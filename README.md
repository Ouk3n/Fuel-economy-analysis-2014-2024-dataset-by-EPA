# Fuel Economy Analysis (2014 vs 2024 EPA Dataset)

## Overview
This project analyzes fuel economy data provided by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for two years: **2014** and **2024**. The analysis focuses on several key metrics, including:

- **Fuel Economy (MPG)**: Miles per gallon (MPG) for various vehicle classes.
- **Greenhouse Gas Score**: Environmental score based on the vehicle's greenhouse gas emissions.
- **Vehicle Class**: Categories of vehicles (e.g., compact, SUV, sedan, etc.).
- The dataset used for this project is provided by the [U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)](https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/download.shtml) and can be accessed for further details.
## Objective
The main goal of this project is to:

1. **Load the dataset**: Import the fuel economy data from an **Excel (XLSX)** file.
2. **Perform exploratory analysis**: Investigate relationships between MPG, greenhouse gas score, and vehicle class.
3. **Explore correlation**: Examine the relationship between fuel economy (MPG) and greenhouse gas emissions scores for vehicles in both the 2014 and 2024 datasets.

## Installation
To run this project, ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

```bash
pip install pandas openpyxl matplotlib seaborn
